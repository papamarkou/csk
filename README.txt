CSK is simulation software for assessing the performance of Chaos Shift 
Keying (CSK) communication systems. It is free software under the GNU General 
Public License.

The current version of CSK supports the simulation of Bit Error Rate (BER) in 
single-user coherent CSK and in single-user non-coherent CSK for a range of 
spreading sequences, some of which are the result of the developers' research on 
the optimization of spreading.

CSK is written in C++ with its software engineering geared towards the 
minimization of execution time.
