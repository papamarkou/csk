The CSK source code has been compiled successfully on Linux, Mac OS X Mountain 
Lion and Windows 7. This means that as long as the user's operating system has 
Boost installed and his IDE of preference supports importing C++ code, the 
source should compile with no errors. The accompanying makefile in the
build directory currently supports installation on Linux only.

*************** Installation Instructions on Linux ***************

1) cd to the build directory and run

make

This assumes that the default location of the dynamic Boost libraries is

/opt/boost/1_53_0/lib

and the default location of the static Boost libraries is

/opt/boost/1_53_0/include

If Boost is installed elsewhere, then the "boost-lib" and "boost-include"
options can be used for pointing to the dynamic and static Boost libraries,
respectively. For instance, the equivalent invocation for the above default
locations would be

make boost-lib=/opt/boost/1_53_0/lib boost-include=/opt/boost/1_53_0/include

2) Make sure that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes the path to
the dynamic Boost libraries. For instance, assuming that bash is the default
shell, this can be achieved by adding the following command to ~/.bashrc

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/opt/boost/1_53_0/lib

where /opt/boost/1_53_0/lib is the presumed path to the dynamic boost libraries.

Depending on the configuration of the Boost library, it may be needed to
update in a similar way the CPLUS_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so as to
point to the static Boost libraries

export CPLUS_LIBRARY_PATH=${CPLUS_LIBRARY_PATH}:/opt/boost/1_53_0/include

This is not a prerequisite for the installation itself, yet is required for
running CSK after installation.

3) The "csk" binary generated by make resides in the build directory. It can be 
copied to the user's location of preference and the PATH environment
variable can be updated accordingly.
